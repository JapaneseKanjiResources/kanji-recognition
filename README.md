# Kanji recognition

## Introduction

This project is inspired by the Tensorflow tutorial on [MNIST handwritten digit](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/estimators/cnn) when I was learning Convolutional Nerual Networks.

This project demonstrates building a CNN to recognize Japanese kanji characters.

## Implementations

- [Tensorflow - Python](README.ipynb)

- [Tensorflow.js](https://github.com/kuroemon2509/kanji-recognition/tree/gh-pages) to deploy the model on the web.

- [Android] - Working on
